# Decision Tree Regression Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Decision Tree Regressor** to predict salaries based on years of experience and age using the `Salary_Data.csv` dataset. It involves training and testing a decision tree model, visualizing the results, and predicting salary based on input features.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `Salary_Data.csv`, which contains the following features:

- **YearsExperience**: Number of years of work experience.
- **Age**: Age of the employee.
- **Salary**: Salary of the employee.

A small sample of the dataset:

| YearsExperience | Age  | Salary |
|-----------------|------|--------|
| 1.1             | 21.0 | 39343  |
| 1.3             | 21.5 | 46205  |
| 1.5             | 21.7 | 37731  |
| 2.0             | 22.0 | 43525  |
| 2.2             | 22.2 | 39891  |
